I am a Marie Curie Early Stage researcher at The Open University, UK working in European Union's Horizon 2020 [QUARTZ](http://www.quartz-itn.eu/) project. My role is to investigate user behaviour in online information interactions and build mathematical models inspired from Quantum Theory. My research interests lie broadly in Computational Social Science, particularly in Behavioural Data Science, which is about using data science techniques to draw insights from, and model human behavioural data. I am interested in predicting behaviours of [System 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) type.
